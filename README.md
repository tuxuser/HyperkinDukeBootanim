## WARNING

This page describes actions that might damage your device or firmware. Proceed with care!
Everything you do is under your own responsibility!
No guarantee for correctness of this information is given!
You will void your device's warranty!

## How to

1. Disassemble controller
2. Dump the flash chip
3. Split out the FAT16 image from the flash dump
4. Copy your desired animation video to the filesystem
5. Inject the modified FAT16 image back into the flash image
6. Write the new data to flash chip
7. Test functionality!
8. Assemble controller
9. Profit

## USB interface

USB VID: 0x2e24

USB PID: 0x0652

### Bootloader mode ?

- Hold Start + Back-button, then plug in the controller

Controller gets detected with following USB interface:

VID: 0x11c0

PID: 0x5500


## SoC

Chip Id: GPL32705B (Generalplus)

Product Brief: [Generalplus website](http://www.generalplus.com/pLVfLN1229SVpfSNnormal_download)

Possibly related sourcecode: [Github](https://github.com/ablueway/fullmac/tree/master/os/MicroC)

## Flash Chip

Chip Id: YC25Q32B (Mfg: YC CHIP)

Packaging: SOIC-8

Size: 4MB

Datasheet: [YC Chip Website](http://www.ycchip.cn/att/YC25Q32B.pdf)

## Tools

This repository holds following tools:

* convert_video.sh -> Bash script wrapper around ffmpeg video conversion command
* flashdump_tool.py -> Python tool to extract/inject filesystem image and extract bootloader & nvram

## Converting a video file

The original bootanimation is 7.96 seconds long, lets assume 8 seconds is also fine

In this example ffmpeg is used for the transcoding

```sh
ffmpeg \
  -i input.mp4 \         # Input video file
  -an \                  # Ditch audio stream
  -c:v mjpeg \           # Encode as MJPEG
  -s 240x320 \           # Output resolution: 240x320
  -aspect 3:4 \          # Aspect ratio
  -filter:v fps=fps=25 \ # Frames per second
  -vf "transpose=2" \    # Optional: Rotate 90 degress counter-clockwise
  -ss 00:00:02 -t 8 \    # Optional: Trim video (Start at second 2, duration of 8 seconds)
  test.avi               # Output filename
```

Check if resulting file looks nice and plays, then copy it into the FAT16 filesystem image.

## Dumping / Flashing

### Via hardware flasher

The hardware programmer MiniPro TL866II Plus supports it.

Chip gets detected as:

* ACE ACE25QC320G
* BOYA Micro BY25Q32AS

### Via SPI

SPI is also an option according to the datasheet.

![SPI pinout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tuxuser/HyperkinDukeBootanim/master/spi_flash_pinout.png)

Raspberry Pi + [flashrom](https://www.flashrom.org/RaspberryPi) can likely be used to interact... (not verified)

### UART

Seems unavailable (via stock bootloader at least...)

## Memory content

```
0x00000000-0x00002000 NVRAM
0x00002000-0x0008D000 Bootloader
0x0008D000-0x0010D000 <EMPTY SPACE>
0x0010D000-0x00400000 FAT16 Filesystem image
```

### Bootloader

ALOT of debug strings, bootloader referenced as "GP DV BootLoader v2.2".

Use flash dump tool to extract it from the flash dump.

Disassemble by choosing "ARM Little-Endian" and Load Address "0x2000".

### FAT16 filesystem image

Contains a single file, **test.avi**.

```
Input #0, avi, from 'test.avi':
  Metadata:
    encoder         : Lavf57.41.100
  Duration: 00:00:07.96, start: 0.000000, bitrate: 1229 kb/s
    Stream #0:0: Video: mjpeg (MJPG / 0x47504A4D), yuvj420p(pc, bt470bg/unknown/unknown), 240x320 [SAR 1:1 DAR 3:4], 1225 kb/s, 25 fps, 25 tbr, 25 tbn, 25 tbc
```

### Checksums

Apparently **none** for the FAT16 filesystem image.

## Mounting the FAT16 image for modification

### Linux/Unix

Simply use **mount** (with msdos-utils / vfat support installed ofc)

```sh
mkdir /tmp/fat16volume
mount image.bin /tmp/fat16volume
# Copy new bootanim
cp new_test.avi /tmp/fat16volume/test.avi
sync
# Unmount again
umount /tmp/fat16volume
```

### Windows

Use something like [OSFMount](https://www.osforensics.com/tools/mount-disk-images.html)
